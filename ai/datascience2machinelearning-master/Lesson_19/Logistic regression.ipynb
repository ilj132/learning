    "In the previous scatter plot, you'll notice that the **gpa** column and the **admit** column do not have a clear linear relationship. Recall that the **admit** column only contains the values 0 and 1 and are used to represent binary values and the numbers themselves don't carry any weight. When numbers are used to represent different options or categories, they are referred to as **categorical values**. Classification focuses on estimating the relationship between the independent variables (x) and the dependent (y), **categorical variable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll focus on a classification technique called **logistic regression**. While a **linear regression** model outputs a real number as the label, a **logistic regression** model outputs a probability value. In binary classification, if the probability value is larger than a certain threshold probability, we assign the label for that row to 1 or 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "This threshold probability is something we select, and we'll learn about how to select a good threshold probability in later classes. For now, let's dive more into how logistic regression works."

In logistic regression, we use the **logistic function**, which is a version of the linear function that is adapted for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore some of the **logistic function's** properties to better understand why it's useful for **classification** tasks. Unlike in linear regression, where the output can be any real value, in **logistic regression** the output has to be a real value between 0 and 1, since the output represents a probability value. Note that the model can't output a negative value or it would violate this criteria.\n",

We won't dive into the math and the steps required to fit a logistic regression model to the training data in this pratice. We'll instead focus on using the **scikit-learn** library to fit a model between the **gpa** and **admit** columns. Recall that the **gpa** column contains the GPA of each applicant as a real value between **0.0** and **4.0** and the **admit** column specifies if that applicant was admitted (0 if not admitted and 1 if admitted). Since we're only working with one feature, **gpa**, this is referred to as a univariate model.\n",
